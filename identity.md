# Brand Identity

## General
- Colorful, bright, bold, slightly playful, but always professional.   
- Use of emojis in common interface elements to help convey meaning and messaging.  
From Mailchimp's Styleguide: 
    > Emoji are a fun way to add humor and visual interest to your writing, but use them infrequently and deliberately.


## Written Content

## Buttons
Buttons should always contain actions. The language should be clear and concise. All button text should be uppercase.

## Titles, Headings & Subheadings
Headings and subheadings organize content for readers. Be generous and descriptive.

Headings (H1) give people a taste of what they‚Äôre about to read. Use them for page and blog titles.

Subheadings (H2, H3, etc.) break articles into smaller, more specific sections. They give readers avenues into your content and make it more scannable.

Headings and subheadings should be organized in a hierarchy, with heading first, followed by subheadings in order. (An H2 will nestle under H1, an H3 under H2, and on down.)

Include the most relevant keywords in your headings and subheadings, and make sure you cover the main point of the content.

Use title case, unless the title/heading/subheading is a punctuated sentence. If the heading is a punctuated sentence, use sentence case.

## Navigation Links
Use title case for main or global navigation. Use sentence case for subnavigation.

Navigation links should be clear and concise.

## Checkboxes & Radio Buttons
Use title case for headings and sentence case for button and checkbox fields.

## Links
Provide a link whenever you‚Äôre referring to something on an external website. Use links to point users to relevant content and trusted external resources.

Don‚Äôt include preceding articles (a, an, the, our) when you link text. For example:

- Yes: Read the [automation guide]() for details.
- No: Read [the automation guide]() for details.

If a link comes at the end of a sentence or before a comma, don‚Äôt link the punctuation mark.

Don‚Äôt say things like ‚ÄúClick here!‚Äù or ‚ÄúClick for more information‚Äù or ‚ÄúRead this.‚Äù Write the sentence as you normally would, and link relevant keywords.

Links should look different than regular copy, strong text, or emphasis text. They should have a hover state that communicates they‚Äôre interactive, and should have a distinct active and visited state. When setting the hover state of links, be sure to include focus state as well, to help readers using assistive technologies and touch devices.
