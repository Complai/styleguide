#### General
Capitalization is used to help define hierarchy and the structure of content on a page but at Shep it also helps to frame how we tell a story. Headlines should be written in sentence case, never title case or all caps. Secondary information should also appear in sentence case. Body copy should be in sentence case and utilize a period for a complete sentence. No end punctuation is needed for a sentence fragment unless it's followed by a sentence or another fragment.

Use a serial comma or series comma. This is also known as an Oxford comma.

Avoid abbreviations for first reference — though airport codes, and other well-known instances are exceptions.

Limit number of emojis or emoticons to once per encounter, generally.

#### In general, write as you speak

A good rule of thumb, imagine you are writing to a single reader, maybe a close friend, but not to a group of strange people.

Compare, for example, the difference between these two sentences:

“For those of you who are interested, you can learn more about it here.”
“If you’re interested in learning more, you can find out more about it here.”

It’s a subtle change, for sure, but the second sentence sounds much more personal and sincere than the first one.

In general, think about your audience. Who is it? What are their hopes and fears? What do they struggle with? What kind of jokes or cultural references would make them laugh? After all, you’d probably talk differently if you were having a jovial conversation with a group of old friends out for dinner than with a group of potential clients at a conference out-of-town.

There's a fine line here about being too casual but in general, the way that we talk through things because that’s how humans talk and not a dense set of business rules and guidelines.

#### Links
Provide a link whenever you’re referring to something on an external website. Use links to point users to relevant content and trusted external resources.

Don’t include preceding articles (a, an, the, our) when you link text. For example:

- Yes: Read the [automation guide]() for details.
- No: Read [the automation guide]() for details.

If a link comes at the end of a sentence or before a comma, don’t link the punctuation mark.

Don’t say things like “Click here!” or “Click for more information” or “Read this.” Write the sentence as you normally would say it, and link relevant keywords.

Links should look different than regular copy, strong text, or emphasis text. They should have a hover state that communicates they’re interactive, and should have a distinct active and visited state. When setting the hover state of links, be sure to include focus state as well, to help readers using assistive technologies and touch devices.
