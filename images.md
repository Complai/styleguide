# Images & Graphics 

In order to present an optimal experience for users on both the website and the Browser Extension, images and graphics should be optimized for both quality and size. Use the table below for the appropriate optimization tools. 

## Acceptable Formats

| Type | Formats | Fallback | Notes | Optimization |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Graphics | SVG | PNG | With [94.97%](https://caniuse.com/#search=svg) browser support and their inherent scalability (they just look good anywhere!), SVGs should be used for all graphics, whenever possible. As a fallback, high quality PNGs should be used with `srcset` or `picture` element. | [SVGOMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/) | 
| Photographs | JPG | -- | There should rarely be a reason to use anything other than a JPG. | [TinyJPG](https://tinyjpg.com/) |
