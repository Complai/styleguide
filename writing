#### General
Capitalization is used to help define hierarchy and the structure of content on a page but at Shep it also helps to frame how we tell a story. Headlines should be written in sentence case, never title case or all caps. Secondary information should also appear in sentence case. Body copy should be in sentence case and utilize a period for a complete sentence. No end punctuation is needed for a sentence fragment unless it's followed by a sentence or another fragment.

Use a serial comma or series comma. This is also known as an Oxford comma.

Avoid abbreviations for first reference — though airport codes, and other well-known instances are exceptions.

Limit number of emojis or emoticons to once per encounter, generally.

#### Links
Provide a link whenever you’re referring to something on an external website. Use links to point users to relevant content and trusted external resources.

Don’t include preceding articles (a, an, the, our) when you link text. For example:

- Yes: Read the [automation guide]() for details.
- No: Read [the automation guide]() for details.

If a link comes at the end of a sentence or before a comma, don’t link the punctuation mark.

Don’t say things like “Click here!” or “Click for more information” or “Read this.” Write the sentence as you normally would, and link relevant keywords.

Links should look different than regular copy, strong text, or emphasis text. They should have a hover state that communicates they’re interactive, and should have a distinct active and visited state. When setting the hover state of links, be sure to include focus state as well, to help readers using assistive technologies and touch devices.
